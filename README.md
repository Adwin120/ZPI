# Car Detailing Management System
This project aims to create a web application for tracking provided services and working hours for a company specializing in supplying workers and detailing car inventory to car dealerships. Automating the entry of car data will increase the efficiency of employee work, while the database itself will facilitate the process of creating business estimates for clients and payroll reconciliation with employees. The application will also assist in communication among employees and allow for reporting faults/issues. Additionally, it will enable clients to monitor work progress on their cars in the dealership. The system will also facilitate browsing and adding contracts between the client and the company, enhancing trust and transparency in the work performed at client locations.
